Its important that the latest code structure, function, objective, tasks and upcoming tasks to be maintained in [cursorInfo.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/cursorInfo.mdc) 

It is also advised that whenever the LLM is confused how things work it take a look at cursorInfo.mdc for ground truth. 

If you ever come across mismatch between reality of the codebase and what i represented in cursorInfo.mdc, update cursorInfo.md.

At the end of each response, make it a point to update the cursorInfo.mdc if you have changed something that matters.

cursorInfo.mdc is not a change log but a status snapshot of the project. You dont have to update that you have chagned somethign but only say that the codebase is this way and does this.

make sure u use the right path for updating [cursorInfo.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/cursorInfo.mdc) its within .cursor/rules
